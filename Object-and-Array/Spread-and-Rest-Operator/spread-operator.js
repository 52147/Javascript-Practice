// Spread Operator
// The spread operator allows an iterable such as an array to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected.
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const newArr = [...arr, 6, 7];
console.log(newArr); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
