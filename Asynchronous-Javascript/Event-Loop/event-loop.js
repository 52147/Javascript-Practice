// Event Loop
// The event loop is a mechanism that handles the execution of multiple pieces of JavaScript code, including callbacks, promises, and events.

// Example Explanation:

// Call Stack: Executes synchronous code.
// Task Queue: Holds asynchronous callbacks.
// Microtask Queue: Holds promises.
// Event Loop: Moves tasks from the queue to the call stack.
